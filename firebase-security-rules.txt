FIREBASE SECURITY RULES SETUP GUIDE
====================================

Your Firebase API key is PUBLIC (this is normal and safe).
Security comes from Firebase Security Rules, not hiding the key.

HOW TO SET UP SECURITY RULES:
------------------------------

1. Go to Firebase Console: https://console.firebase.google.com/
2. Select your project: zentrainersync
3. Go to: Firestore Database → Rules tab
4. Replace the rules with the following:

--- START RULES ---
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    // Public read/write for the artifacts collection (your app's data)
    // This allows anyone to read/write routines and history
    // Since your app uses anonymous auth, this is appropriate
    match /artifacts/{projectId}/public/data/{collection}/{document=**} {
      allow read, write: if true;
    }

    // Deny all other access
    match /{document=**} {
      allow read, write: if false;
    }
  }
}
--- END RULES ---

5. Click "Publish"

OPTIONAL: RESTRICT API KEY BY DOMAIN
-------------------------------------

To prevent others from using your API key on other domains:

1. Go to: Firebase Console → Project Settings → Your apps
2. Click on your web app
3. Under "API key restrictions", add:
   - HTTP referrers: https://joevon.github.io/*
   - HTTP referrers: http://localhost:*

This prevents the API key from working on unauthorized domains.

IMPORTANT NOTES:
----------------
- The API key CANNOT access your data without proper Security Rules
- Even with the API key, users can only do what Security Rules allow
- Your current setup uses anonymous authentication, which is fine for public data
- If you want user-specific data later, you'll need to add user-based Security Rules
